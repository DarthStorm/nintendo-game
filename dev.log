rewrote wall jump
added bg
tried to add 3x jump, oh well I guess NOT!!!
zzzzzzzzzzz................................................................................................................................
day 4: finally added 3x jump
added player color var, 3x jump uses player color as hints, maybe some momentum required?
nah
fixed bug that lets player stick to ceil. STICKY STICKY GO AWAY!!!!!
added little tiny particles  for 3x jump
remade the engine into a tile based one WHYYYY
the tile system not working, probably coz levelstr.split is not splitting anything
nvm fixed it
tmr need to fix collision system: no absolute "001" selector
use tiletemplates from last plat:prepped
zzzzzzzzzzzz................................................................
day 4: imported lvl from my other platformer
